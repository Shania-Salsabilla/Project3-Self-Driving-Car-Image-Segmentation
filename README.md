## Introduction:
Major cities worldwide are facing two major problems on the streets: congestion and a high number of traffic accidents. According to the WHO, road traffic is one of the most complex and dangerous systems we face daily. One of the main factors that cause traffic accidents is driver negligence.

Self-Driving Car technology equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to reduce accidents and congestion. With AI's ability to segment objects in images from the vehicle's perspective, this system can assist in faster and more accurate decision-making on the road, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by human error.

## Objective: 
This project aims to build an AI system capable of segmenting objects from images and videos.  We will implement three popular segmentation algorithms namely: FCN8, U-Net, and SegNet. The project will include implementation, optimization (hyperparameter tuning), and evaluation to determine the most effective algorithm.
